# Conquer Island Revamped

Conquer the island by defeating all the lions on the board.<br>
Clicking on a tile makes it change from lion to dog or viceversa.<br>
Adjacent tiles are also flipped.<br>
This game was inspired by the [Lights out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game)) game and is a revamp of the game I made back in 2020 using Vue 2 and bootstrap Vue (js ecosystem has changed a lot indeed) [Conquer Island](https://github.com/luisthedragon/conquer-island)
